    <h3>section-1</h3>
    <p id="section1">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag to define the structure of web pages.
    This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.</p>
    <h3>section-2</h3>
    <p id="section2">HTML uses predefined tags and elements that tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements include an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag.
    Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.</p>

    <h3>section-4</h3>
    <p id="section4">The HTML anchor tag, also known as the anchor tag, plays an important role in web development. It defines hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate from one page to another. Understanding how to use this  tag effectively is essential for creating well-structured and user-friendly websites.</p>
    <h3>section-5</h3>
    <p id="section5">A linked page typically opens in the current browser window, but can be targeted elsewhere. For example, to open a link in a new window add property target=”_blank”. The href Attribute is the most critical attribute of the  element is href, which specifies the link’s destination. HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
    Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
    Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
    Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
    Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.</p>
